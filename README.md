*** Steel Slitting Stand Dimension Calculator ***

The motivation of the software:

The application facilitates the optimization of strip cutting, for cold and hot rolled steel coil(s) with the aim 
of maximising finished good and reducing waste.

Based on the following inputs/parameters the program will produce the optimal cutting pattern:
- The calculator creates the optimal cutting pattern for the manufacture of one or more coil(s).
- The pattern is capabale of munufacturing five different strip widths simultaneously.
- The pattern is capabale of munufacturing four different coil inner diameters.
- Strip weight determination per unit weight based on different dimensions selected for picking.
- Determination of the mass of strips in total and  mass per strip size.
- Determination of the proportion of dimensions.
- Determination of strip diameter based on different sheet dimensions.
- Determination of the body thickness of the strip related to the size and number of sheets required.
- Calculates losses taking into account  surface and material defect rates.
- Determination of the amount of waste generated.
- The software issues warning messages to create the correct slitting dimensions.
